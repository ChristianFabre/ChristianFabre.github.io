Viva College! ☺ ☺

“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” 
---Nelson Mandela

College is freedom. College is youth. College is camaraderie. College is learning life skills.  College propels an all-encompassing feeling that ‘nothing is impossible’.  
It’s that time of the year again when the gates of Colleges and Universities will open up to usher in the next class of students. It’s exciting to start life in a campus, to a new journey, to achieve greater heights in academics, adulthood & beyond. Responsibilities of the student during college days shouldn’t be underestimated. 

Dressing has seen its peak of creativity in the campus. Sometime quirky, sometime plain simple, everything they wear is nothing less than a style and fashion statement! Colleges have been the timeless, universal platforms where generations of students have seen self -declared designers walk the corridors of knowledge. Here clothes speak of attitude. Talented teenagers tirelessly use their thinking caps to showcase a sense of dressing that make heads turn. 
However, there are basic dressing guidelines to consider while building a wardrobe for college life. The challenge lies in choosing the bare minimum basics for a start, keeping in mind the storage space available. Individual clothing needs and fashion sense might differ, but once part of the campus inner circle, idea of college attire soon changes. Shopping becomes an impulsive act and the number of t-shirts and accessories add up for various events and clubs. The wardrobe definitely expands.
  
Men’s line of clothes for college must include denim Jeans, t-shirts, trousers and button-down with tie (for special occasions). Other basics like jackets, sweaters, gym wear, pyjamas, bathrobe and a swimsuit will be required regularly. Loafers, boat shoes, sneakers are choices depending on the weather. Flip- flops are a constant favourite.

College is a celebration of people from across cultures. College is so you! Go ahead and achieve academic credentials while bonding to make great lifetime friends. ☺ ☺ ☺
