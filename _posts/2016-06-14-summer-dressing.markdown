Cool Summer Dressing!

104°F by day and 96°F by night!  That’s Indian summer! It’s scorching and is unbearable at times. All Indian schools close for summer vacation in order to beat the heat and the neighbourhood swimming pools get busy with children loving a splash. There is no walking the thin lines where clothing is concerned this season.  It’s got to be the bare minimum comfort wear in cool colours.  

This is the time when one needs to use up SPF creams and sun tan lotions.  This is the time for sunglasses and sun hats. Summer is the time to grab those fruity cold shakes & soups, cold coffees and the traditional Indian drink, ‘Thandai’. This is the time to have multiple baths, choose the perfect deo & after shave and find lighter shades of clothing. This is the time to get to higher altitudes and feel the cool mountain air.

In all sensibilities our closets must be replaced with breezy, lightweight whites, tans, Khakis and aqua that are comfortable to wear. The world famous Madras checked shirt is a great pick for this season. What you wear is what you feel and the lighter the colour shades, the better. As events unfold on hot summer days, go on and bring out those whites, off –whites, pastel coloured single weaves and knits.
The cut and fit can be a personal choice. As temperatures rise, it will be important to encourage air circulation with slightly loose garments in single weave since perspiring degrees can get high. Make an effort to choose natural fibres. Cotton would be ideal to wave off heat. Single woven cotton has been ever-trusted, time- tested for summer months. I call it the ‘breathing material’. It’s durable, less expensive, and is available in vibrant colours.    

Men’s corporate wear is universal. Hot weather corporate dressing is absolutely acceptable with half an inch loose fit short or rolled up sleeves shirt being paired up with a lightweight neatly fitted formal trouser. A good tie and a clean dial watch to accessorise, give the needed look that completes the official attire for summer.   

Camel shorts with a crew –neck Tee worn with a pair of boat shoes is elegant for busy summer days. Summer time calls for light and clean dressing that spell understatement and constant freshness. Extensively washed light weight Jeans, Chinos and Shorts, are good summer wears. 

Shorts can be tailored about 2-3 inches above the knee and are mostly worn with tees and sandals in the hot weather. But do remember that shorts are not acceptable for all occasions and may be kept aside for week-ends and casual evenings. For a sophisticated dress –up, shorts can be worn with tucked-in Polo shirts and belt. Keep your toe nails neatly trimmed if wearing sandals. Lightweight Canvas sneakers or boat shoes are good for a stylish appeal.
A bottle of water, facial tissues and a change of clothes for a quick freshen –up will be handy on a summer day.
